# FederatedLearningSecurity

## Motivation
This repository provides code to investigate the security issues of federated learning systems under the scope of different attack methods and countermeasures. We simulate the attacks using the federated learning framework, Flower. The code can be used to reproduce results and conclusions from the papers listed below, all simulated via the Flower framework.
