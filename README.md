# FederatedLearningSecurity

## Motivation
This repository provides code to investigate the security issues of federated learning systems under the scope of different attack methods and countermeasures. We simulate the attacks using the federated learning framework, Flower. The code can be used to reproduce results and conclusions from the papers listed below, all simulated via the Flower framework.  

## Quick start
In order to run the code, all you have to do is simply download and run the notebooks. The notebooks are self-explanatory and the code is modular, so it's very easy to integrate and test your own machine learning models and datasets.
